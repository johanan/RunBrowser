# RunBrowser
This was an idea that I have had for awhile. Build a [RunKeeper](http://runkeeper.com/home) like application that runs (no pun intended) in the browser. This works best on an iPhone, but it should work in Android.
## Features
* LocalStorage
* GPS Tracking
* Offline Caching 

## Libraries used

* [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com)
* [Open Layers](http://openlayers.org/)

You can view a [post](http://ejosh.co/de/2012/04/html-5-run-tracking-application/) I made about the creation.
